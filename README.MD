# Flipper SPI Terminal

SPI TERMINAL is a SPI App, which allows you to control external devices using SPI. Your Flipper can act as a SPI Master or Slave device. The Slave mode allows you to sniff the communication between different SPI peripherals.

The App uses the Low-Level SPI Interface of the STM32WB55RG Microprocessor. All data is transmitted with DMA Sub-module and can reach speeds of up to 32 Mbit/s in Master and up to 24 Mbit/s in Slave mode.

It contains a rich [Inbuilt Documentation](#inbuilt-documentation).

> **Note:** The current version does not support the sending of data. This is planned for future versions.

## GPIO

> **CAUTION:** Do not use 5V signals! Flipper Zero is only 5V tolerant, if a pin is configured as input. If you connect a 5V signal to a output, it will damage your Flipper!
> For details see: <https://docs.flipperzero.one/gpio-and-modules#svyi9>

| Pin | Label | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 2 (PA7) | MOSI | Master out / Slave in |
| 3 (PA6) | MISO | Master in / Slave out |
| 4 (PA4) | CS/NSS | Chip select / Non Slave Select |
| 5 (PB3) | SCK | Serial Clock |

## Configuration

SPI Terminal offers access to all of the Flipper Zero SPI settings. Your configuration will be reloaded on the next launch. The config file is located at `/ext/apps_data/flipper_spi_terminal/last_settings.settings`.

A few advanced settings can only be accessed though the Flipper CLI. Please refer to the [CLI](#cli) section for details.

The full list of configuration options found in [`flipper_spi_terminal_config_declarations.h`.](https://github.com/janwiesemann/flipper-spi-terminal/blob/master/flipper_spi_terminal_config_declarations.h)

## Terminal Screen

The Terminal Screen is the main part of this application. Is can display received data in multiples modes. Currently they are `Auto`, `Text`, `Hex` and `Binary`.

New data is added in a rolling buffer. This means, that the screen can be rendered without the need of copying huge amounts of data.

## Inbuilt Documentation

Flipper SPI Terminal contains a inbuilt documentation for each configuration setting. It can be accessed though the `Center` button on the configuration screen.

For a deep understanding of all the configuration options, I would recommend the `STM Reference Manual RM0434`. The SPI-Section (`Section 35.`) is located on page `1177`. A link can be found below in the [External References](#external-references) section.

## CLI

Flipper SPI Terminal offers a limited set of CLI-Commands. They are currently only used for debugging purposes.

A full list can be found in [`flipper_spi_terminal_cli_commands.h`](https://github.com/janwiesemann/flipper-spi-terminal/blob/master/flipper_spi_terminal_cli_commands.h).

The list can also be accessed though the `spi help` command.
