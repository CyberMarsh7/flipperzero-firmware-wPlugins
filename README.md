# Gemini-Flipper

Currently in development stage, here I'm going to upload the .js code that I currently use so that anyone who wants to join and help improve it can make their PRs and also for those C developers who want to help create the native Flipper app and be accessible by everyone from https://lab.flipper.net/apps

# TO DO

--> improve the handling of how the APs are saved, currently it saves them but rewrites the previous one

--> improve the handling of how the saved APs are sent to the esp32 to avoid re-entering the SSID and password (Improving the previous point this should solve itself)

--> load the firmware binary for the esp32 (nothing to do here just load the binary)
