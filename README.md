This is a flipper app that counts how much you move in your sleep.
Shoutout to MatthewKuKanich https://github.com/MatthewKuKanich/flipper-radar he is the one that made the original app for this Radar module.
I took his code and just heavily modified it to be a sleep counter so that I can set this up on my flipper place it near my bed and when i go to sleep have it count how much I move around,
The fap application is in the dist folder.
