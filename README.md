# Sleep Counter Flipper App
This is a flipper app that counts how much you move in your sleep.
Shoutout to MatthewKuKanich https://github.com/MatthewKuKanich/flipper-radar he is the one who made the original app for this Radar module.
I took his code and just heavily modified it to be a sleep counter so that I can set this up on my flipper, place it near my bed, and when I go to sleep have it count how much I move around.
The fap application is in the dist folder.
