# LORA_DEMO

This is Not intended to be a full demo, but a simple example of how to use the SPI interface on the Flipper Zero.
Flipper Zero and the chip that supports SPI, such as the W25Q32.

The connections are:
- Flipper Pin 2 - MOSI (D0 on the W25Q32)
- Flipper Pin 3 - MISO (D1 on the W25Q32)
- Flipper Pin 4 - CS (CS on the W25Q32)
- Flipper Pin 5 - SCK (SLK on the W25Q32)
- Flipper Pin 8 - GND (GND on the W25Q32)
- Flipper Pin 9 - 3V3 (VCC on the W25Q32)
